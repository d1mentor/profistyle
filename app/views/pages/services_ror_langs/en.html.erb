						<div class="ruby__label"><h1>RUBY ON RAILS WEB DEVELOPMENT</h1></div>

						<div class="ruby__title"><h2>Development process</h2></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">To understand how we develop our Ruby on Rails applications, you can take a look at
							the main development steps.</div>

						<div class="ruby__title"><h2>1. Main stages of development</h2></div>
						<div class="ruby__subtitle"><h3>Review of Terms of Reference</h3></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">The development of a web application is carried out on the basis of the terms of
							reference (TOR). Specialists developers study technical specifications in detail, because The key to
							success when developing an application is strict compliance with the requirements. To create an
							application on Ruby on Rails, it is not necessary to know all the standards by heart, but in order to do
							it efficiently, specialists must work with the documentation. You communicate with developers in the
							language of the terms of reference. It is often difficult for people who are not close to technical
							sciences to draw up technical specifications. Our experts will help you with this.</div>
						<div class="ruby__subtitle"><h3>Domain Introduction</h3></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">Before starting development in accordance with the TOR, specialists study the
							subject area. For example, you want to develop an online auto parts store with integration into your
							warehouse and accounting programs. We need to study in detail the features of online sales of auto parts,
							the range of cars, software products for selecting spare parts by make / model or VIN code of a car,
							explore the possibilities of integrating other software products with a web application, and much more.
						</div>
						<div class="ruby__subtitle"><h3>Modeling a future Ruby on Rails application</h3></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">After getting acquainted with the TK and the subject area, specialists need to
							schematically present a model of the future application. Not only the development of a web application on
							Ruby on Rails, but any other requires a clear idea of ​​the final result. Otherwise, any complex
							application will not work correctly, if at all. Our developers always work on the principle of measure 7
							times — cut 1 time.</div>
						<div class="ruby__subtitle"><h3>Getting Started</h3></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">Upon completion of the modeling, the specialists distribute responsibilities and
							begin developing the web application according to the previously agreed scheme. With this approach, the
							probability of force majeure is extremely low, the work goes quickly and efficiently.</div>
						<div class="ruby__subtitle"><h3>Testing</h3></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">No developer in the world can avoid mistakes. Therefore, after writing the code, it
							is immediately checked and, if necessary, corrected. Testing is a guarantee that your Ruby on Rails online
							store will work properly, and you will not lose a penny due to a sudden failure of the web application.
						</div>

						<div class="ruby__title"><h2>2. Maintenance of finished software</h2></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">We provide a full range of services for maintaining and modernizing our Ruby on
							Rails applications. The finished software is accompanied by technical documentation, with its help any
							developer can easily understand the program code.</div>
						<div class="ruby__subtitle"><h3>Technical documentation</h3></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">In the process of developing a web application, the programmer begins to write
							technical documentation. It includes information about the software. In what environment was the
							development carried out, and why in it. What plugins were used and why. What problems may arise. It is
							very important to maintain documentation for further support and modernization of the application.</div>

						<div class="ruby__title"><h2>3. Ruby on Rails development standards</h2></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">In the web development environment, there are certain application development and
							security standards that must be followed because such a Ruby on Rails application will be difficult to
							hack and easy to understand for another developer. We work strictly according to web development
							standards, so you can be sure that there will be no problems with your application in the future.</div>
						<div class="ruby__subtitle"><h3>Security Standards</h3></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">There are a number of security standards, such as rules for storing passwords in a
							database. The passwords in the database are stored in an encrypted form, this ensures that when the
							database is hacked, a hacker will not be able to use the obtained passwords to harm your application.
						</div>
						<div class="ruby__subtitle"><h3>Design Standards</h3></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">When developing, it is also necessary to use standards, for example, the so-called
							<a href="https://github.com/arbox/ruby-style-guide/blob/master/README-ruRU.md">style code</a> . The Ruby on Rails application code must be properly structured. It is
							necessary to avoid complex structures, piling up of monotonous functions, etc. This ensures that the
							author of the application, or any other programmer, will easily understand the program code and be able to
							work with it. Otherwise, it can be easier to develop a web application from scratch than to understand
							what inexperienced developers have written.</div>
						<div class="ruby__title"><h2>4. Why do our programmers choose Ruby on Rails?</h2></div>
						<div class="ruby__text">It’s all about the ease of use of this framework for developing web applications.
							There are a number of ready-made and fully customizable modules that allow you to quickly create a Ruby on
							Rails application. The Ruby programming language was originally created for the convenience of the
							programmer. But most importantly, the Ruby on Rails web application has high performance and security, and
							Ruby on Rails web sites have a high potential for <a href="/services_seo?lang=en">SEO promotion</a> in the TOP of search
							engines.</div>
