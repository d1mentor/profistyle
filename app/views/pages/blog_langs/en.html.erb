									<div class="blog__el-title">Why do we need web applications?</div>
									<div class="blog__el-text">Today, the Internet occupies a significant niche in the life of every
										person. People buy, sell, communicate, relax and develop using the Internet. Considering that today
										everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, any applications, including web applications based on
										Ruby on Rails, have become more relevant than ever. What could be more convenient than a social
										network, or a delivery service right on the smartphone screen? And besides, not in the browser, but
										as an independent application.</div>

									<div class="blog__el-title">A variety of development tools</div>
									<div class="blog__el-text">With the popularization of web applications, came a variety of development
										tools, today the developer has thousands of tools to work with anything from photo editing to
										writing code. Among developers, disputes often arise about which tools are better, more efficient.
										Many professionals choose Ruby in Rails development for its simplicity and efficiency. An
										experienced developer knows that each tool has its own clear function, you won’t drive a nail with a
										screwdriver, will you?</div>

									<div class="blog__el-title">Why do our experts work with Ruby on Rails?</div>
									<div class="blog__el-text">Ruby on Rails is a kind of developer’s multitool, this tool has absorbed
										all the best from other development tools. RoR allows you to increase the functionality of the
										application in a matter of minutes without acquiring the so-called «crutches». Developing with Ruby
										on Rails is convenient and therefore fast. We all understand that after quality, the main factor in
										development is speed. With Ruby on Rails, a developer can write efficiently and quickly.</div>

									<div class="blog__el-title">The process of creating a web application using Ruby on Rails</div>
									<div class="blog__el-text">First of all, a specialist needs to study the subject area. Why is he
										making an app? After the developer, like a portrait painter, creates the layout of the application,
										he must outline the main functional parts of the application. If we consider the Model View
										Controller model, then usually among them are the application entities, their controllers, and what
										the user sees — views. Then the next step is to write, debug the program code and the Ruby on Rails
										web application is ready. An experienced developer knows that the more time he devotes to design,
										the less complexity will arise during the implementation phase of the application.</div>

									<div class="blog__el-title">Are you a big business owner and still don’t have your app?</div>
									<div class="blog__el-text">Then you’ve come to the right place, our specialists can develop an
										application on Ruby on Rails for every taste, whether it’s a simple inventory application, or an
										entire online store. You will be able to follow the development stages to make sure your application
										is reliable. The main thing to remember is that from an economic point of view, a web application is
										the right investment, because in the future it will bring or increase your income.</div>
